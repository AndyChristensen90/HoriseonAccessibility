# HoriseonAccessibility
Accessibility Refactor 01

This is Horiseon

In this assignment we refactored the original source code to optimize for search engines. 
This includes replacing non semantic tags (`<div>`, `<span>`) with semantic tags, to better understand the structure more clearly when reading the HTML. The structure of the HTML should be independant of styling.
